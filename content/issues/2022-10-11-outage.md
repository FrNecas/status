We are experiencing issues with the execution of the tasks.
(The statuses are waiting in the `The task was accepted.` state.)
We are investigating the cause.
Sorry about the possible troubles.
We will try to fix this as soon as possible.

Updates:

- Tue Oct 11 12:24:02 UTC: We are slowly going through the queue. Please, be patient.
- Tue Oct 11 13:12:36 UTC: We have gone through the queue and you should experience regular response times.
  The original cause is still not known but the problem probably occured during an SRPM upload to Copr.
  (It can be a fault on our or Copr side.)
- Wed Oct 12 05:27:46 UTC: Service operated normally since the last update.
  To reduce the chance of this, we [plan to move the building of SRPMs to Copr](https://packit.dev/posts/copr-srpms/).
  (Currently default for new installations and opt in for other projects.)
