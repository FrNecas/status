We had an outage which started in the Friday EU afternoon and was fully
resolved on Saturday EU morning. Most of the jobs were failing during this
time. This was caused by a misconfiguration on our side. We apologize for the
inconvenience. We're going to take steps to prevent the misconfiguration from
happening in future.
