We are going to move deployment of our production Packit Service to a new cluster.
It should take about 1/2 an hour, during which the workers will be down and queries
to API & dashboard won't work properly because the database will be being migrated.
Any requests submitted to the API meanwhile should, however, be fulfilled once the workers are
up again.
